**FAQ**
1) Why is my app slow to start the first time?
- The app is creating a local database of all the information needed for the app to function. This is the trade-off that comes with not requiring an active internet connection. Subsequent start times should be pretty snappy, only loading the various images the app needs.

2) Why do you not have certain companion/combative combinations and information?
- There is a lot of information on the internet. Not all of it is 100% accurate. The application has some data scraped from fairly reputable sources but also note that companion planting is not an exact science and there is a lot of conflicting data. If there is something you feel should absolutely be added please email our support at gardenbuddyapp@mailfence.com

3) Why is feature _X_ missing?
- Please request new features at gardenbuddyapp@mailfence.com

4) Why does the app look like a video game from the 90s or early 2000s?
- I wanted to differentiate the app from the many ultra-modern look and feel apps that exist. I will probably add some optional textures that you can switch between in the future, but my primary focus will be new functions and features.
